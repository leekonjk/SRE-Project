Techniques:

Identification of Techniques: The systematic review identified various techniques for requirements traceability, including goal-centric traceability.
Importance: These techniques are crucial for ensuring that requirements can be traced from their emergence to fulfillment in a software development project.
Lack of Validation: Many of these techniques lack empirical validation through experiments or industry case studies, raising concerns about their effectiveness in practice.
Tools:

Availability: The review emphasized the availability of tools for requirements traceability, essential for managing and maintaining traceability throughout the project lifecycle.
Purpose: These tools facilitate the linking of requirements to design, implementation, and testing artifacts, streamlining the traceability process.
Validation Concerns: However, many of these tools lack empirical validation, meaning their real-world effectiveness remains uncertain until validated through rigorous testing.
Challenges:

Awareness and Education: Industry case studies highlighted challenges related to awareness and education about the importance and benefits of traceability among stakeholders.
Cost Concerns: Cost emerged as a significant factor influencing the implementation of traceability policies in projects, impacting project motivation and resource allocation.
Organizational Adaptation: Implementing traceability requires changes to existing processes, roles, and responsibilities within the organization, presenting challenges in integration and adaptation.
Conclusion:

Critical Aspect: Requirements traceability is critical in software engineering, requiring consideration of techniques, tools, and challenges.
Addressing Challenges: Addressing challenges related to awareness, cost, and organizational adaptation is crucial for successful implementation.
Improving Outcomes: Leveraging appropriate techniques and tools, while ensuring empirical validation, can lead to improved project outcomes and stakeholder satisfaction.
